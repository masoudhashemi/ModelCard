Model cards are a simple way to make models more understandable and to encourage responsible use. They are a lightweight way to document the key characteristics of a model, and to provide a checklist for ethical considerations. They are designed to be completed by the model developers, and to be shared with the users of the model.

This site is a collection of model cards for machine learning models. The goal is to provide a resource for model developers and users to learn from each other. We hope that this will help to improve the transparency and accountability of machine learning models.
