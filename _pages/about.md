The team works closely with other teams within ServiceNow to ensure that all processes and systems are designed with trust and governance in mind, and they also work to continuously improve and enhance the trust and governance capabilities of the company's services. 

The goal of the Trust and Governance Lab is to ensure that ServiceNow's customers can have confidence in the security, integrity, and reliability of the company's SaaS offerings, and to help the company maintain its reputation as a trusted provider of cloud-based services.
